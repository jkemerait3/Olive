Study inclusion/exclusion criteria of note:







Inclusion: persistent insomnia per Research Diagnostic Criteria (American Academy of Sleep Medicine); current PTSD treatment with medication and/or specialized PTSD program or individual psychotherapy for at least 3 months







Exclusion: prior sleep restriction therapy or ""cognitive restructuring therapies for beliefs related to sleep""; current  treatment using benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine receptor agonists, opiates, trazodone, or over-the-counter sleep aids; Insomnia Severity Index score of 0 to 14.







Participants in the waitlist condition were offered CBT-I following completion of the research protocol.







Additional outcomes reported in the publication include sleep diary items, actigraphy data, and polysomnography. Publication also reports information on randomization, therapist training and supervision, and treatment fidelity.







PTSD duration reported as mean (SD) of 18.48 (2.05) in the text, and as 18.5 (2.1) for All Participants inTable 1, however the standard deviations reported in Table 1 for each intervention arm are 13.6 and 13.8, so it is possible that the 2.05 is actually the SEM, not SD.

Secondary publication comments:
Berke 2021 pools data from 3 RCTs (Resick 2015, Resick 2017, and Foa 2018) and from treatment arms within studies (no treatment comparison).
Straud 2021 reports AUDIT scores at follow-up but only stratified by baseline drinking so not abstracted; abstracted dichotomous SUD outcome only.
LoSavio 2021 provides additional data related to childhood abuse history; reports on a secondary analysis for moderating effect of a history of childhood abuse.

Fifty-five patients (88.71%) of participants met full diagnostic criteria for panic attacks based on the Anxiety Disorders Intervention Schedule-Revised.







After completing a 12-week waiting period, women initially randomized to waitlist group received treatment.







Baseline MPSS-SR scores were significantly different between treatment and waitlist groups (p=0.0443), but it does not appear that the study adjusted for this difference. Since study did not specify how participants were randomized, the randomization process resulting in this biased group assignment is questionable.
