Among individuals who are nonverbal or have language deficits, observable signs such as changes in sleep or eating and increases in chal- lenging behavior should trigger an evaluation for anxiety or depression. Specific learning dif- ficulties (literacy and numeracy) are common, as is developmental coordination disorder. Medical conditions commonly associated with autism spectrum disorder should be noted under the “associated with a known medical/genetic or environmental/acquired condition” specifier. Such medical conditions include epilepsy, sleep problems, and constipation. Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder is a fairly frequent presenting feature of autism spectrum disorder, and extreme and narrow food preferences may persist.

Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activities (e.g., overlooks or misses details, work is inaccurate). b. Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities (e.g., has diffi- culty remaining focused during lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading). c. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly (e.g., mind seems else- where, even in the absence of any obvious distraction). d. Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focus and is easily sidetracked). e. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g., difficulty managing se- quential tasks; difficulty keeping materials and belongings in order; messy, dis- organized work; has poor time management; fails to meet deadlines). f. Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers). g.

Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g., leaves his or her place in the classroom, in the office or other workplace, or in other situations that require remaining in place). c. Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate. (Note: In ad- olescents or adults, may be limited to feeling restless.) d. Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly. e. Is often “on the go,” acting as if “driven by a motor” (e.g., is unable to be or un- comfortable being still for extended time, as in restaurants, meetings; may be experienced by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with). f. Often talks excessively. g. Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed (e.g., com- pletes people’s sentences; cannot wait for turn in conversation). h. Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn (e.g., while waiting in line). i. Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations, games, or activities; may start using other people’s things without asking or receiving per- mission; for adolescents and adults, may intrude into or take over what others are doing). B. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12 years. C. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in two or more set- tings (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities). D. There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, so- cial, academic, or occupational functioning. E.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. Inattention manifests behaviorally in ADHD as wandering off task, lacking persistence, having difficulty sustaining focus, and being disorganized and is not due to defiance or lack of comprehension. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity (such as a child running about) when it is not appropriate, or excessive fidgeting, tapping, or talk- ativeness. In adults, hyperactivity may manifest as extreme restlessness or wearing others out with their activity. Impulsivity refers to hasty actions that occur in the moment without forethought and that have high potential for harm to the individual (e.g., darting into the street without looking). Impulsivity may reflect a desire for immediate rewards or an in- ability to delay gratification. Impulsive behaviors may manifest as social intrusiveness (e.g., interrupting others excessively) and/or as making important decisions without con- sideration of long-term consequences (e.g., taking a job without adequate information). ADHD begins in childhood. The requirement that several symptoms be present before age 12 years conveys the importance of a substantial clinical presentation during child-"}
{"disorder": "adhd", "chunk_id": 4, "text": "hood. At the same time, an earlier age at onset is not specified because of difficulties in es- tablishing precise childhood onset retrospectively. Adult recall of childhood symptoms tends to be unreliable, and it is beneficial to obtain ancillary information. Manifestations of the disorder must be present in more than one setting (e.g., home and school, work). Confirmation of substantial symptoms across settings typically cannot be done accurately without consulting informants who have seen the individual in those set- tings. Typically, symptoms vary depending on context within a given setting. Signs of the disorder may be minimal or absent when the individual is receiving frequent rewards for appropriate behavior, is under close supervision, is in a novel setting, is engaged in espe- cially interesting activities, has consistent external stimulation (e.g., via electronic screens), or is interacting in one-on-one situations (e.g., the clinician's office). Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Mild delays in language, motor, or social development are not specific to ADHD but often co- occur. Associated features may include low frustration tolerance, irritability, or mood lability. Even in the absence of a specific learning disorder, academic or work performance is often im- paired. Inattentive behavior is associated with various underlying cognitive processes, and in- dividuals with ADHD may exhibit cognitive problems on tests of attention, executive function, or memory, although these tests are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to serve as di- agnostic indices. By early adulthood, ADHD is associated with an increased risk of suicide at- tempt, primarily when comorbid with mood, conduct, or substance use disorders. No biological marker is diagnostic for ADHD. As a group, compared with peers, chil- dren with ADHD display increased slow wave electroencephalograms, reduced total brain volume on magnetic resonance imaging, and possibly a delay in posterior to anterior cortical maturation, but these findings are not diagnostic. In the uncommon cases where there is a known genetic cause (e.g., Fragile X syndrome, 22q11 deletion syndrome), the ADHD presentation should still be diagnosed. Prevalence Population surveys suggest that ADHD occurs in most cultures in about 5% of children and about 2.5% of adults. 62 Neurodevelopmental Disorders Development and Course Many parents first observe excessive motor activity when the child is a toddler, but symp- toms are difficult to distinguish from highly variable normative behaviors before age 4 years. ADHD is most often identified during elementary school years, and inattention be- comes more prominent and impairing."}
{"disorder": "adhd", "chunk_id": 5, "text": "The disorder is relatively stable through early ad- olescence, but some individuals have a worsened course with development of antisocial behaviors. In most individuals with ADHD, symptoms of motoric hyperactivity become less obvious in adolescence and adulthood, but difficulties with restlessness, inattention, poor planning, and impulsivity persist. A substantial proportion of children with ADHD remain relatively impaired into adulthood. In preschool, the main manifestation is hyperactivity. Inattention becomes more prom- inent during elementary school. During adolescence, signs of hyperactivity (e.g., running and climbing) are less common and may be confined to fidgetiness or an inner feeling of jitteriness, restlessness, or impatience. In adulthood, along with inattention and restless- ness, impulsivity may remain problematic even when hyperactivity has diminished. Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. ADHD is associated with reduced behavioral inhibition, effortful con- trol, or constraint; negative emotionality; and/or elevated novelty seeking. These traits may predispose some children to ADHD but are not specific to the disorder. Environmental. Very low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams) conveys a two- to three- fold risk for ADHD, but most children with low birth weight do not develop ADHD. Al- though ADHD is correlated with smoking during pregnancy, some of this association reflects common genetic risk. A minority of cases may be related to reactions to aspects of diet. There may be a history of child abuse, neglect, multiple foster placements, neurotoxin exposure (e.g., lead), infections (e.g., encephalitis), or alcohol exposure in utero. Exposure to environmental toxicants has been correlated with subsequent ADHD, but it is not known whether these associations are causal. Genetic and physiological. ADHD is elevated in the first-degree biological relatives of individuals with ADHD. The heritability of ADHD is substantial. While specific genes have been correlated with ADHD, they are neither necessary nor sufficient causal factors. Visual and hearing impairments, metabolic abnormalities, sleep disorders, nutritional de- ficiencies, and epilepsy should be considered as possible influences on ADHD symptoms. ADHD is not associated with specific physical features, although rates of minor phys- ical anomalies (e.g., hypertelorism, highly arched palate, low-set ears) may be relatively elevated. Subtle motor delays and other neurological soft signs may occur. (Note that marked co-occurring clumsiness and motor delays should be coded separately [e.g., de- velopmental coordination disorder].) Course modifiers. Family interaction patterns in early childhood are unlikely to cause ADHD but may influence its course or contribute to secondary development of conduct problems. Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues"}
{"disorder": "adhd", "chunk_id": 6, "text": "Differences in ADHD prevalence rates across regions appear attributable mainly to differ- ent diagnostic and methodological practices. However, there also may be cultural varia- tion in attitudes toward or interpretations of children’s behaviors. Clinical identification rates in the United States for African American and Latino populations tend to be lower than for Caucasian populations. Informant symptom ratings may be influenced by cul- tural group of the child and the informant, suggesting that culturally appropriate practices are relevant in assessing ADHD. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 63 Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues ADHD is more frequent in males than in females in the general population, with a ratio of approximately 2:1 in children and 1.6:1 in adults. Females are more likely than males to present primarily with inattentive features. Functional Consequences of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD is associated with reduced school performance and academic attainment, social re- jection, and, in adults, poorer occupational performance, attainment, attendance, and higher probability of unemployment as well as elevated interpersonal conflict. Children with ADHD are significantly more likely than their peers without ADHD to develop con- duct disorder in adolescence and antisocial personality disorder in adulthood, conse- quently increasing the likelihood for substance use disorders and incarceration. The risk of subsequent substance use disorders is elevated, especially when conduct disorder or an- tisocial personality disorder develops. Individuals with ADHD are more likely than peers to be injured. Traffic accidents and violations are more frequent in drivers with ADHD. There may be an elevated likelihood of obesity among individuals with ADHD. Inadequate or variable self-application to tasks that require sustained effort is often in- terpreted by others as laziness, irresponsibility, or failure to cooperate. Family relation- ships may be characterized by discord and negative interactions. Peer relationships are often disrupted by peer rejection, neglect, or teasing of the individual with ADHD. On av- erage, individuals with ADHD obtain less schooling, have poorer vocational achievement, and have reduced intellectual scores than their peers, although there is great variability. In its severe form, the disorder is markedly impairing, affecting social, familial, and scholas- tic/occupational adjustment. Academic deficits, school-related problems, and peer neglect tend to be most associ- ated with elevated symptoms of inattention, whereas peer rejection and, to a lesser extent, accidental injury are most salient with marked symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity. Differential Diagnosis Oppositional defiant disorder. Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder may re- sist work or school tasks that require self-application because"}
{"disorder": "adhd", "chunk_id": 7, "text": "they resist conforming to others' demands. Their behavior is characterized by negativity, hostility, and defiance. These symptoms must be differentiated from aversion to school or mentally demanding tasks due to difficulty in sustaining mental effort, forgetting instructions, and impulsivity in individuals with ADHD. Complicating the differential diagnosis is the fact that some individuals with ADHD may develop secondary oppositional attitudes toward such tasks and devalue their importance. Intermittent explosive disorder. ADHD and intermittent explosive disorder share high levels of impulsive behavior. However, individuals with intermittent explosive disorder show serious aggression toward others, which is not characteristic of ADHD, and they do not experience problems with sustaining attention as seen in ADHD. In addition, intermit- tent explosive disorder is rare in childhood. Intermittent explosive disorder may be diag- nosed in the presence of ADHD. Other neurodevelopmental disorders. The increased motoric activity that may occur in ADHD must be distinguished from the repetitive motor behavior that characterizes stereo- typic movement disorder and some cases of autism spectrum disorder. In stereotypic movement disorder, the motoric behavior is generally fixed and repetitive (e.g., body rock- ing, self-biting), whereas the fidgetiness and restlessness in ADHD are typically general- ized and not characterized by repetitive stereotypic movements. In Tourette’s disorder, 64 Neurodevelopmental Disorders frequent multiple tics can be mistaken for the generalized fidgetiness of ADHD. Prolonged observation may be needed to differentiate fidgetiness from bouts of multiple tics. Specific learning disorder. Children with specific learning disorder may appear inat- tentive because of frustration, lack of interest, or limited ability. However, inattention in individuals with a specific learning disorder who do not have ADHD is not impairing out- side of academic work. Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder). Symptoms of ADHD are common among children placed in academic settings that are inappropriate to their intel- lectual ability. In such cases, the symptoms are not evident during non-academic tasks. A diagnosis of ADHD in intellectual disability requires that inattention or hyperactivity be excessive for mental age. Autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with ADHD and those with autism spectrum disorder exhibit inattention, social dysfunction, and difficult-to-manage behavior. The so- cial dysfunction and peer rejection seen in individuals with ADHD must be distinguished from the social disengagement, isolation, and indifference to facial and tonal communica- tion cues seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Children with autism spec- trum disorder may display tantrums because of an inability to tolerate a change from"}
{"disorder": "adhd", "chunk_id": 8, "text": "their expected course of events. In contrast, children with ADHD may misbehave or have a tan- trum during a major transition because of impulsivity or poor self-control. Reactive attachment disorder. Children with reactive attachment disorder may show social disinhibition, but not the full ADHD symptom cluster, and display other features such as a lack of enduring relationships that are not characteristic of ADHD. Anxiety disorders. ADHD shares symptoms of inattention with anxiety disorders. Indi- viduals with ADHD are inattentive because of their attraction to external stimuli, new activities, or preoccupation with enjoyable activities. This is distinguished from the inat- tention due to worry and rumination seen in anxiety disorders. Restlessness might be seen in anxiety disorders. However, in ADHD, the symptom is not associated with worry and rumination. Depressive disorders. Individuals with depressive disorders may present with inabil- ity to concentrate. However, poor concentration in mood disorders becomes prominent only during a depressive episode. Bipolar disorder. Individuals with bipolar disorder may have increased activity, poor concentration, and increased impulsivity, but these features are episodic, occurring sev- eral days at a time. In bipolar disorder, increased impulsivity or inattention is accompa- nied by elevated mood, grandiosity, and other specific bipolar features. Children with ADHD may show significant changes in mood within the same day; such lability is dis- tinct from a manic episode, which must last 4 or more days to be a clinical indicator of bi- polar disorder, even in children. Bipolar disorder is rare in preadolescents, even when severe irritability and anger are prominent, whereas ADHD is common among children and adolescents who display excessive anger and irritability. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by pervasive irritability, and intolerance of frustration, but impulsiveness and disorganized attention are not essential features. However, most children and adoles- cents with the disorder have symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD, which is diag- nosed separately. Substance use disorders. Differentiating ADHD from substance use disorders may be problematic if the first presentation of ADHD symptoms follows the onset of abuse or fre- quent use. Clear evidence of ADHD before substance misuse from informants or previous records may be essential for differential diagnosis. Other Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 65 Personality disorders. In adolescents and adults, it may be difficult to distinguish ADHD from borderline, narcissistic, and other personality disorders. All these disorders tend to share the features of disorganization, social intrusiveness,"}
{"disorder": "adhd", "chunk_id": 9, "text": "emotional dysregulation, and cognitive dysregulation. However, ADHD is not characterized by fear of abandonment, self-injury, extreme ambivalence, or other features of personality disorder. It may take extended clinical observation, informant interview, or detailed history to distinguish im- pulsive, socially intrusive, or inappropriate behavior from narcissistic, aggressive, or dom- ineering behavior to make this differential diagnosis. Psychotic disorders. ADHD is not diagnosed if the symptoms of inattention and hyperac- tivity occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic disorder. Medication-induced symptoms of ADHD. Symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity attributable to the use of medication (e.g., bronchodilators, isoniazid, neuro- leptics [resulting in akathisia], thyroid replacement medication) are diagnosed as other specified or unspecified other (or unknown) substance–related disorders. Neurocognitive disorders. Early major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) and/or mild neurocognitive disorder are not known to be associated with ADHD but may present with similar clinical features. These conditions are distinguished from ADHD by their late onset. Comorbidity In clinical settings, comorbid disorders are frequent in individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for ADHD. In the general population, oppositional defiant disorder co-occurs with ADHD in approximately half of children with the combined presentation and about a quarter with the predominantly inattentive presentation. Conduct disorder co-occurs in about a quarter of children or adolescents with the combined presentation, depending on age and setting. Most children and adolescents with disruptive mood dysregulation dis- order have symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD; a lesser percentage of children with ADHD have symptoms that meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disor- der. Specific learning disorder commonly co-occurs with ADHD. Anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder occur in a minority of individuals with ADHD but more often than in the general population. Intermittent explosive disorder occurs in a minority of adults with ADHD, but at rates above population levels. Although substance use disor- ders are relatively more frequent among adults with ADHD in the general population, the disorders are present in only a minority of adults with ADHD. In adults, antisocial and other personality disorders may co-occur with ADHD. Other disorders that may co-occur with ADHD include obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disorders, and autism spectrum disorder. Other Specified Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder 314.01 (F90.8) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in so- cial, occupational or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria"}
