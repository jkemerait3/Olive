For children 6 years and younger, see corresponding criteria below. A. Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in one (or more) of the following ways: 1. Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s). 2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others. 3. Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a close family member or close friend. In cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the event(s) must have been violent or accidental. 4. Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains; police officers repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse). Note: Criterion A4 does not apply to exposure through electronic media, television, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work related. B. Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred: 1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event(s). Note: In children older than 6 years, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the traumatic event(s) are expressed. 2. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream are related to the traumatic event(s). Note: In children, there may be frightening dreams without recognizable content. 3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on a continuum, with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings.) Note: In children, trauma-specific reenactment may occur in play. 4. Intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s). 5. Marked physiological reactions to internal or external cues that symbolize or re- semble an aspect of the traumatic event(s). C.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the development of char- acteristic symptoms following exposure to one or more traumatic events."}
{"disorder": "ptsd", "chunk_id": 5, "text": "Emotional re- actions to the traumatic event (e.g., fear, helplessness, horror) are no longer a part of Criterion A. The clinical presentation of PTSD varies. In some individuals, fear-based re- experiencing, emotional, and behavioral symptoms may predominate. In others, anhe- donic or dysphoric mood states and negative cognitions may be most distressing. In some other individuals, arousal and reactive-externalizing symptoms are prominent, while in others, dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally, some individuals exhibit combina- tions of these symptom patterns. The directly experienced traumatic events in Criterion A include, but are not limited to, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual physical assault (e.g., physical attack, robbery, mugging, childhood physical abuse), threatened or actual sexual violence (e.g., forced sexual penetration, alcohol/drug-facilitated sexual penetration, abu- sive sexual contact, noncontact sexual abuse, sexual trafficking), being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war, natural or hu- man-made disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents. For children, sexually violent events may include developmentally inappropriate sexual experiences without physical violence or injury. A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not neces- sarily considered a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events in- volve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g., waking during surgery, anaphylactic shock). Witnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious injury, unnatural death, physical or sexual abuse of another person due to violent assault, domes- tic violence, accident, war or disaster, or a medical catastrophe in one’s child (e.g., a life- threatening hemorrhage). Indirect exposure through learning about an event is limited to experiences affecting close relatives or friends and experiences that are violent or acciden- tal (e.g., death due to natural causes does not qualify). Such events include violent per- Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 275 sonal assault, suicide, serious accident, and serious injury. The disorder may be especially severe or long-lasting when the stressor is interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, sex- ual violence). The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual has recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion B1). Intrusive recollections in PTSD are distinguished from depressive rumination in that they apply only to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories. The emphasis is on recurrent memories of the event that usually include sensory, emotional, or physiological behavioral components. A common reexperiencing symptom is distressing dreams that replay the event itself or that are representative or"}
{"disorder": "ptsd", "chunk_id": 6, "text": "thematically related to the major threats involved in the traumatic event (Criterion B2). The individual may experience dissociative states that last from a few seconds to several hours or even days, during which components of the event are relived and the individual behaves as if the event were occurring at that mo- ment (Criterion B3). Such events occur on a continuum from brief visual or other sensory intrusions about part of the traumatic event without loss of reality orientation, to complete loss of awareness of present surroundings. These episodes, often referred to as “flash- backs,” are typically brief but can be associated with prolonged distress and heightened arousal. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play or in dissociative states. Intense psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological re- activity (Criterion B5) often occurs when the individual is exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., windy days after a hurricane; seeing someone who resembles one’s perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e.g., dizziness for survivors of head trauma; rapid heartbeat for a previously traumatized child), particularly for individuals with highly somatic presentations. Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently (e.g., always or almost always) avoided. The individual commonly makes deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts, memories, feelings, or talking about the traumatic event (e.g., utilizing distraction techniques to avoid internal reminders) (Criterion C1) and to avoid activities, objects, situations, or people who arouse recollections of it (Criterion C2). Negative alterations in cognitions or mood associated with the event begin or worsen after exposure to the event. These negative alterations can take various forms, including an inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event; such amnesia is typically due to dissociative amnesia and is not due to head injury, alcohol, or drugs (Criterion D1). Another form is persistent (i.e., always or almost always) and exaggerated negative ex- pectations regarding important aspects of life applied to oneself, others, or the future (e.g., “I have always had bad judgment”; “People in authority can’t be trusted”) that may man- ifest as a negative change in perceived identity since the trauma (e.g., “I can’t trust anyone ever again”; Criterion D2). Individuals with PTSD may have persistent erroneous cogni- tions about the causes of the traumatic event that lead them to blame themselves or others (e.g., “It’s all my fault"}
{"disorder": "ptsd", "chunk_id": 7, "text": "that my uncle abused me”) (Criterion D3). A persistent negative mood state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, shame) either began or worsened after exposure to the event (Criterion D4). The individual may experience markedly diminished interest or participation in previously enjoyed activities (Criterion D5), feeling detached or es- tranged from other people (Criterion D6), or a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (especially happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, and sexuality) (Criterion D7). Individuals with PTSD may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and/or physical behavior with little or no provocation (e.g., yelling at people, get- ting into fights, destroying objects) (Criterion E1). They may also engage in reckless or self- destructive behavior such as dangerous driving, excessive alcohol or drug use, or self- injurious or suicidal behavior (Criterion E2). PTSD is often characterized by a heightened sensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic experience (e.g., following a motor vehicle accident, being especially sensitive to the threat potentially 276 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders caused by cars or trucks) and those not related to the traumatic event (e.g., being fearful of suffering a heart attack) (Criterion E3). Individuals with PTSD may be very reactive to un- expected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response, or jumpiness, to loud noises or unexpected movements (e.g., jumping markedly in response to a telephone ringing) (Cri- terion E4). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily events (e.g., forgetting one’s telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g., following a conver- sation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported (Criterion E5). Problems with sleep onset and maintenance are common and may be associated with nightmares and safety concerns or with generalized elevated arousal that interferes with adequate sleep (Criterion E6). Some individuals also experience persistent dissociative symptoms of de- tachment from their bodies (depersonalization) or the world around them (derealization); this is reflected in the “with dissociative symptoms” specifier. Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Developmental regression, such as loss of language in young children, may occur. Audi- tory pseudo-hallucinations, such as having the sensory experience of hearing one’s thoughts spoken in one or more different voices, as well as paranoid ideation, can be pres- ent. Following prolonged, repeated, and severe traumatic events (e.g., childhood abuse, torture), the individual may additionally experience difficulties in regulating emotions or maintaining stable interpersonal relationships, or dissociative symptoms. When the"}

Prevalence In the United States, projected lifetime risk for PTSD using DSM-IV criteria at age 75 years is 8.7%. Twelve-month prevalence among U.S. adults is about 3.5%. Lower estimates are seen in Europe and most Asian, African, and Latin American countries, clustering around 0.5%–1.0%. Although different groups have different levels of exposure to traumatic events, the conditional probability of developing PTSD following a similar level of expo- sure may also vary across cultural groups. Rates of PTSD are higher among veterans and others whose vocation increases the risk of traumatic exposure (e.g., police, firefighters, emergency medical personnel). Highest rates (ranging from one-third to more than one- half of those exposed) are found among survivors of rape, military combat and captivity, and ethnically or politically motivated internment and genocide. The prevalence of PTSD may vary across development; children and adolescents, including preschool children, generally have displayed lower prevalence following exposure to serious traumatic events; however, this may be because previous criteria were insufficiently developmen- tally informed. The prevalence of full-threshold PTSD also appears to be lower among older adults compared with the general population; there is evidence that subthreshold presentations are more common than full PTSD in later life and that these symptoms are associated with substantial clinical impairment. Compared with U.S. non-Latino whites, higher rates of PTSD have been reported among U.S. Latinos, African Americans, and American Indians, and lower rates have been reported among Asian Americans, after ad- justment for traumatic exposure and demographic variables. Development and Course PTSD can occur at any age, beginning after the first year of life. Symptoms usually begin within the first 3 months after the trauma, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before criteria for the diagnosis are met. There is abundant evidence for what DSM-IV called “delayed onset” but is now called “delayed expression,” with the recogni- tion that some symptoms typically appear immediately and that the delay is in meeting full criteria. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 277 Frequently, an individual’s reaction to a trauma initially meets criteria for acute stress disorder in the immediate aftermath of the trauma. The symptoms of PTSD and the rela- tive predominance of different symptoms may vary over time. Duration of the symptoms also varies, with complete recovery within 3 months occurring in approximately one-half of"}
{"disorder": "ptsd", "chunk_id": 9, "text": "adults, while some individuals remain symptomatic for longer than 12 months and sometimes for more than 50 years. Symptom recurrence and intensification may occur in response to reminders of the original trauma, ongoing life stressors, or newly experienced traumatic events. For older individuals, declining health, worsening cognitive function- ing, and social isolation may exacerbate PTSD symptoms. The clinical expression of reexperiencing can vary across development. Young children may report new onset of frightening dreams without content specific to the traumatic event. Before age 6 years (see criteria for preschool subtype), young children are more likely to ex- press reexperiencing symptoms through play that refers directly or symbolically to the trauma. They may not manifest fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or during reex- periencing. Parents may report a wide range of emotional or behavioral changes in young children. Children may focus on imagined interventions in their play or storytelling. In ad- dition to avoidance, children may become preoccupied with reminders. Because of young children’s limitations in expressing thoughts or labeling emotions, negative alterations in mood or cognition tend to involve primarily mood changes. Children may experience co- occurring traumas (e.g., physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence) and in chronic cir- cumstances may not be able to identify onset of symptomatology. Avoidant behavior may be associated with restricted play or exploratory behavior in young children; reduced par- ticipation in new activities in school-age children; or reluctance to pursue developmental op- portunities in adolescents (e.g., dating, driving). Older children and adolescents may judge themselves as cowardly. Adolescents may harbor beliefs of being changed in ways that make them socially undesirable and estrange them from peers (e.g., “Now I’ll never fit in”) and lose aspirations for the future. Irritable or aggressive behavior in children and adoles- cents can interfere with peer relationships and school behavior. Reckless behavior may lead to accidental injury to self or others, thrill-seeking, or high-risk behaviors. Individuals who continue to experience PTSD into older adulthood may express fewer symptoms of hy- perarousal, avoidance, and negative cognitions and mood compared with younger adults with PTSD, although adults exposed to traumatic events during later life may display more avoidance, hyperarousal, sleep problems, and crying spells than do younger adults exposed to the same traumatic events. In older individuals, the disorder is associated with negative health perceptions, primary care utilization, and suicidal ideation. Risk and Prognostic Factors Risk (and protective) factors"}
{"disorder": "ptsd", "chunk_id": 10, "text": "are generally divided into pretraumatic, peritraumatic, and posttraumatic factors. Pretraumatic factors Temperamental. These include childhood emotional problems by age 6 years (e.g., prior traumatic exposure, externalizing or anxiety problems) and prior mental disorders (e.g., panic disorder, depressive disorder, PTSD, or obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]). Environmental. These include lower socioeconomic status; lower education; exposure to prior trauma (especially during childhood); childhood adversity (e.g., economic depriva- tion, family dysfunction, parental separation or death); cultural characteristics (e.g., fatal- istic or self-blaming coping strategies); lower intelligence; minority racial/ethnic status; and a family psychiatric history. Social support prior to event exposure is protective. Genetic and physiological. These include female gender and younger age at the time of trauma exposure (for adults). Certain genotypes may either be protective or increase risk of PTSD after exposure to traumatic events. 278 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders Peritraumatic factors Environmental. These include severity (dose) of the trauma (the greater the magnitude of trauma, the greater the likelihood of PTSD), perceived life threat, personal injury, in- terpersonal violence (particularly trauma perpetrated by a caregiver or involving a wit- nessed threat to a caregiver in children), and, for military personnel, being a perpetrator, witnessing atrocities, or killing the enemy. Finally, dissociation that occurs during the trauma and persists afterward is a risk factor. Posttraumatic factors Temperamental. These include negative appraisals, inappropriate coping strategies, and development of acute stress disorder. Environmental. These include subsequent exposure to repeated upsetting reminders, subse- quent adverse life events, and financial or other trauma-related losses. Social support (includ- ing family stability, for children) is a protective factor that moderates outcome after trauma. Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The risk of onset and severity of PTSD may differ across cultural groups as a result of vari- ation in the type of traumatic exposure (e.g., genocide), the impact on disorder severity of the meaning attributed to the traumatic event (e.g., inability to perform funerary rites after a mass killing), the ongoing sociocultural context (e.g., residing among unpunished per- petrators in postconflict settings), and other cultural factors (e.g., acculturative stress in immigrants). The relative risk for PTSD of particular exposures (e.g., religious persecu- tion) may vary across cultural groups. The clinical expression of the symptoms or symp- tom clusters of PTSD may vary culturally, particularly with respect to avoidance and numbing symptoms, distressing dreams, and somatic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, short- ness of breath, heat sensations). Cultural syndromes and idioms of distress influence the expression"}
{"disorder": "ptsd", "chunk_id": 11, "text": "of PTSD and the range of comorbid disorders in different cultures by providing behavioral and cognitive templates that link traumatic exposures to specific symptoms. For example, panic attack symptoms may be salient in PTSD among Cambodians and Latin Americans because of the association of traumatic exposure with panic-like khyâl attacks and ataque de nervios. Comprehensive evaluation of local expressions of PTSD should include assessment of cul- tural concepts of distress (see the chapter “Cultural Formulation” in Section III). Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues PTSD is more prevalent among females than among males across the lifespan. Females in the general population experience PTSD for a longer duration than do males. At least some of the increased risk for PTSD in females appears to be attributable to a greater likelihood of exposure to traumatic events, such as rape, and other forms of interpersonal violence. Within populations exposed specifically to such stressors, gender differences in risk for PTSD are attenuated or nonsignificant. Suicide Risk Traumatic events such as childhood abuse increase a person’s suicide risk. PTSD is associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and presence of the disorder may indicate which individuals with ideation eventually make a suicide plan or actually attempt suicide. Functional Consequences of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is associated with high levels of social, occupational, and physical disability, as well as considerable economic costs and high levels of medical utilization. Impaired function- Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 279 ing is exhibited across social, interpersonal, developmental, educational, physical health, and occupational domains. In community and veteran samples, PTSD is associated with poor social and family relationships, absenteeism from work, lower income, and lower ed- ucational and occupational success. Differential Diagnosis Adjustment disorders. In adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity or type rather than that required by PTSD Criterion A. The diagnosis of an adjustment dis- order is used when the response to a stressor that meets PTSD Criterion A does not meet all other PTSD criteria (or criteria for another mental disorder). An adjustment disorder is also diagnosed when the symptom pattern of PTSD occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet PTSD Criterion A (e.g., spouse leaving, being fired). Other posttraumatic disorders and conditions. Not all psychopathology that occurs in individuals exposed to an extreme stressor should necessarily be attributed to PTSD. The diagnosis requires that trauma exposure precede the onset or exacerbation of pertinent symptoms. Moreover, if"}
{"disorder": "ptsd", "chunk_id": 12, "text": "the symptom response pattern to the extreme stressor meets cri- teria for another mental disorder, these diagnoses should be given instead of, or in addi- tion to, PTSD. Other diagnoses and conditions are excluded if they are better explained by PTSD (e.g., symptoms of panic disorder that occur only after exposure to traumatic re- minders). If severe, symptom response patterns to the extreme stressor may warrant a sep- arate diagnosis (e.g., dissociative amnesia). Acute stress disorder. Acute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the symptom pattern in acute stress disorder is restricted to a duration of 3 days to 1 month following exposure to the traumatic event. Anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In OCD, there are recurrent intrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive thoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually pres- ent, and other symptoms of PTSD or acute stress disorder are typically absent. Neither the arousal and dissociative symptoms of panic disorder nor the avoidance, irritability, and anxiety of generalized anxiety disorder are associated with a specific traumatic event. The symptoms of separation anxiety disorder are clearly related to separation from home or family, rather than to a traumatic event. Major depressive disorder. Major depression may or may not be preceded by a trau- matic event and should be diagnosed if other PTSD symptoms are absent. Specifically, ma- jor depressive disorder does not include any PTSD Criterion B or C symptoms. Nor does it include a number of symptoms from PTSD Criterion D or E. Personality disorders. Interpersonal difficulties that had their onset, or were greatly ex- acerbated, after exposure to a traumatic event may be an indication of PTSD, rather than a personality disorder, in which such difficulties would be expected independently of any traumatic exposure. Dissociative disorders. Dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder, and de- personalization-derealization disorder may or may not be preceded by exposure to a trau- matic event or may or may not have co-occurring PTSD symptoms. When full PTSD criteria are also met, however, the PTSD “with dissociative symptoms” subtype should be considered. Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). New onset of somatic symptoms within the context of posttraumatic distress might be an indication of PTSD rather than conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). Psychotic disorders. Flashbacks in PTSD must be distinguished from illusions, halluci- nations, and other perceptual disturbances that"}
{"disorder": "ptsd", "chunk_id": 13, "text": "may occur in schizophrenia, brief psy- chotic disorder, and other psychotic disorders; depressive and bipolar disorders with 280 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders psychotic features; delirium; substance/medication-induced disorders; and psychotic dis- orders due to another medical condition. Traumatic brain injury. When a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e.g., traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma), symptoms of PTSD may appear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a psychological traumatic event, and tramautic brain injury (TBI)–related neurocognitive symptoms are not mutually exclusive and may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously termed postconcussive (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in brain- injured and non-brain-injured populations, including individuals with PTSD. Because symp- toms of PTSD and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis between PTSD and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible based on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas reexpe- riencing and avoidance are characteristic of PTSD and not the effects of TBI, persistent disori- entation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to PTSD. Comorbidity Individuals with PTSD are 80% more likely than those without PTSD to have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for at least one other mental disorder (e.g., depressive, bipo- lar, anxiety, or substance use disorders). Comorbid substance use disorder and conduct disorder are more common among males than among females. Among U.S. military per- sonnel and combat veterans who have been deployed to recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, co-occurrence of PTSD and mild TBI is 48%. Although most young children with PTSD also have at least one other diagnosis, the patterns of comorbidity are different than in adults, with oppositional defiant disorder and separation anxiety disorder predominat- ing. Finally, there is considerable comorbidity between PTSD and major neurocognitive disorder and some overlapping symptoms between these disorders. Acute Stress Disorder Diagnostic Criteria 308.3 (F43.0) A. Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation in one (or more) of the following ways: 1. Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s). 2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others. 3. Learning that the event(s) occurred to a close family member or close friend.
