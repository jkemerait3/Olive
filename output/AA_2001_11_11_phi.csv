Allen Allen,11/11/2001,"Lately, Iâ€™ve just been feeling really down. Iâ€™m tired all the time, even after sleeping for hours. Iâ€™ve lost interest in the things I used to enjoy like painting or going out with friends. I find myself crying randomly and I just feel hopeless. It's been like this for weeks and Iâ€™m starting to wonder if thereâ€™s something seriously wrong with me.","Based on your clinical context, self-report and inventory scores summary, I can provide some helpful insights. It appears that you may be experiencing symptoms of depression as indicated by your score on the PHQ-4 questionnaire, which is a commonly used tool to screen for depression. However, it's important to note that these are just initial assessments and should not replace professional diagnosis or treatment. I recommend seeking help from a mental health clinician who can provide more comprehensive evaluation and support."
