Alicia  Grant,11/2/1991,"I was in a serious car accident last year and I still think about it almost every day. I get flashbacks whenever I hear loud crashes or see a similar car. I canâ€™t drive anymore. I avoid that whole part of town. At night, I have nightmares and I wake up sweating and panicking. I feel disconnected from people, even my family.","The patient's symptoms of intrusive memories, flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance, and emotional numbing, along with high PCL-5 score, suggest a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."
