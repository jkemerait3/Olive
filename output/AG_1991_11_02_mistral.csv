Alicia  Grant,11/2/1991,"I was in a serious car accident last year and I still think about it almost every day. I get flashbacks whenever I hear loud crashes or see a similar car. I canâ€™t drive anymore. I avoid that whole part of town. At night, I have nightmares and I wake up sweating and panicking. I feel disconnected from people, even my family.","Based on the patient's self-report and the inventory scores, a probable diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is suggested. The patient's persistent thoughts about a traumatic event, flashbacks, avoidance of reminders of the accident, disturbing dreams, and feelings of detachment indicate PTSD symptoms. The low scores on PHQ-9, PDSS-SR, and PID-5-BF suggest that the patient does not have significant depressive or antisocial tendencies, or anxiety symptoms other than PTSD."
