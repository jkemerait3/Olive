Alicia  Grant,11/2/1991,"I was in a serious car accident last year and I still think about it almost every day. I get flashbacks whenever I hear loud crashes or see a similar car. I canâ€™t drive anymore. I avoid that whole part of town. At night, I have nightmares and I wake up sweating and panicking. I feel disconnected from people, even my family.","Based on the clinical context and inventory scores, a concise diagnostic impression could be: You may have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of your car accident. The PHQ-4 score of 12 indicates that you meet the criteria for probable PTSD diagnosis, which is based on the presence of at least one intrusion symptom, two avoidance symptoms, and two arousal/reactivity symptoms. You may benefit from psychotherapy and medication to cope with your trauma and its effects."
