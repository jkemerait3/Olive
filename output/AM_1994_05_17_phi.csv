Alicia  Mitchell,5/17/1994,"I was in a serious car accident last year and I still think about it almost every day. I get flashbacks whenever I hear loud crashes or see a similar car. I canâ€™t drive anymore. I avoid that whole part of town. At night, I have nightmares and I wake up sweating and panicking. I feel disconnected from people, even my family.","Given the clinical context of a serious car accident, flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance behavior, and feeling disconnected from people, the user's self-report suggests a potential diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The fact that the user avoids that part of town, even though it is not directly related to the car accident, indicates the severity of their symptoms. Additionally, the absence of scores on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Inventory and Patient Health Questionnaire-4 suggests a lower level of anxiety symptoms in this case."
