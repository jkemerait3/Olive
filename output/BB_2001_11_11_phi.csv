Bobo Bebo,11/11/2001,"Lately, Iâ€™ve just been feeling really down. Iâ€™m tired all the time, even after sleeping for hours. Iâ€™ve lost interest in the things I used to enjoy like painting or going out with friends. I find myself crying randomly and I just feel hopeless. It's been like this for weeks and Iâ€™m starting to wonder if thereâ€™s something seriously wrong with me.","Based on the clinical context, self-report, and inventory scores summary provided, your symptoms indicate that you may be experiencing depression.
