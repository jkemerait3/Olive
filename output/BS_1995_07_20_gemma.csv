Brandon  Scott,7/20/1995,"I feel like Iâ€™m always either too much or not enough for people. My relationships are intenseâ€”I go from loving someone to hating them in a second. Iâ€™m terrified of being abandoned, and Iâ€™ll do anything to stop that from happening. Sometimes I donâ€™t even know who I am or what Iâ€™m feeling. Itâ€™s exhausting.","The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of borderline personality disorder (BPD), characterized by unstable relationships, intense emotions, and difficulty regulating self-identity. The presence of pervasive insecurity and fear of abandonment further supports the diagnosis."
