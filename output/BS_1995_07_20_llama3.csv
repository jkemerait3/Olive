Brandon  Scott,7/20/1995,"I feel like Iâ€™m always either too much or not enough for people. My relationships are intenseâ€”I go from loving someone to hating them in a second. Iâ€™m terrified of being abandoned, and Iâ€™ll do anything to stop that from happening. Sometimes I donâ€™t even know who I am or what Iâ€™m feeling. Itâ€™s exhausting.","Based on the clinical context and the patient's self-report, a diagnostic impression is that this individual may be experiencing symptoms consistent with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The intense, highly variable emotional experiences, fear of abandonment, and struggles with identity and self-regulation are concerning features. Additionally, the presence of chronic depression-like symptoms and anxiety is also evident."
