Brandon Scott,7/20/1995,"I feel like Iâ€™m always either too much or not enough for people. My relationships are intenseâ€”I go from loving someone to hating them in a second. Iâ€™m terrified of being abandoned, and Iâ€™ll do anything to stop that from happening. Sometimes I donâ€™t even know who I am or what Iâ€™m feeling. Itâ€™s exhausting.","The patient presents with symptoms consistent with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), characterized by intense, unstable interpersonal relationships, fear of abandonment, and identity disturbance. Additionally, the reported emotional instability and self-harm potential might suggest a comorbidity with Emotion Dysregulation Disorder. Further evaluation and a more comprehensive assessment are recommended for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment planning."
