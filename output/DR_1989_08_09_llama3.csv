Daniel  Reyes,8/9/1989,"I canâ€™t stop worrying about everythingâ€”work, my health, my family, even things that donâ€™t really make sense. Itâ€™s like my brain never turns off. Iâ€™m always on edge and Iâ€™ve been having trouble sleeping because of racing thoughts. Sometimes I even feel short of breath or dizzy when it gets really bad.","Based on the patient's self-report and inventory scores, a diagnostic impression suggests that they are experiencing severe symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, characterized by excessive and persistent worry about various aspects of their life. The patient's report of racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, and physical symptoms such as shortness of breath and dizziness when anxious further support this diagnosis. It is also possible that the patient may be experiencing comorbid depression, given the high level of distress and rumination reported."
