Daniel  Reyes,8/9/1989,"I canâ€™t stop worrying about everythingâ€”work, my health, my family, even things that donâ€™t really make sense. Itâ€™s like my brain never turns off. Iâ€™m always on edge and Iâ€™ve been having trouble sleeping because of racing thoughts. Sometimes I even feel short of breath or dizzy when it gets really bad.","Based on the clinical context, self-report, and inventory scores, your diagnostic impression is that you may be experiencing Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The symptoms reported such as excessive worry, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, and physical symptoms like shortness of breath or dizziness align with GAD. However, further evaluation and consultation with a mental health professional are recommended to confirm the diagnosis."
