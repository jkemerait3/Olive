Elena  Zhou,10/5/1999,"Iâ€™ve always felt like I donâ€™t really understand people the way they understand each other. Social situations are exhausting and confusing. I have specific routines and interests that keep me grounded, and when they get disrupted, I get overwhelmed. Iâ€™m good at my job, but I constantly feel out of place and misunderstood.","The patient presents with pervasive social difficulties, difficulties understanding others, and feelings of alienation, suggesting possible difficulties with social cognition or an autism spectrum disorder."
