Elena  Zhou,10/5/1999,"Iâ€™ve always felt like I donâ€™t really understand people the way they understand each other. Social situations are exhausting and confusing. I have specific routines and interests that keep me grounded, and when they get disrupted, I get overwhelmed. Iâ€™m good at my job, but I constantly feel out of place and misunderstood.","Based on the clinical context, self-report, and inventory scores, a diagnostic impression is that this patient may be experiencing significant difficulties with social interactions and relationships, characterized by feelings of being misunderstood and out of place. There may be underlying difficulties with emotional regulation, leading to overwhelming when routines or interests are disrupted. The absence of symptoms related to anxiety, depression, trauma, and substance use suggests that the primary concerns lie in the areas of social cognition and functioning."
