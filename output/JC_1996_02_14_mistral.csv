Jasmine Cole,2/14/1996,"Iâ€™ve always struggled with paying attention, but now that Iâ€™m in a full-time job, itâ€™s worse. I lose track of tasks constantly, I get distracted by the smallest things, and I have a really hard time finishing projects. I feel like Iâ€™m always behind and letting people down, even when I try really hard.","The patient presents with symptoms of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), particularly the inattentive type, as indicated by difficulties with maintaining focus on tasks, easy distraction, and forgetfulness. These symptoms have significantly impaired their ability to complete projects, manage daily activities, and maintain a full-time job. Further assessment and potential referral for specialized evaluation are recommended."
