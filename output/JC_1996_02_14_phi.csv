Jasmine Cole,2/14/1996,"Iâ€™ve always struggled with paying attention, but now that Iâ€™m in a full-time job, itâ€™s worse. I lose track of tasks constantly, I get distracted by the smallest things, and I have a really hard time finishing projects. I feel like Iâ€™m always behind and letting people down, even when I try really hard.","Based on the clinical context, self-report, and inventory scores summary provided, it appears that this person may be experiencing symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). They report difficulty with tasks that involve paying attention and staying focused. Additionally, their score on the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Scale is relatively low at 0. While a single symptom or score alone may not be definitive in diagnosing ADHD, it is important to consider all available information when making a diagnosis."
