Jason  Thompson,1/29/1987,"There are times I feel unstoppableâ€”like I barely need sleep, my thoughts race, I make big plans and spend a lot of money. I feel amazing. But then it crashes. I end up depressed for weeks, canâ€™t get out of bed, donâ€™t answer my phone. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m two completely different people.","The patient exhibits symptoms suggestive of bipolar disorder, characterized by alternating episodes of elevated mood and depressive episodes. The absence of symptoms typically associated with anxiety disorders and depression further supports this diagnosis."
