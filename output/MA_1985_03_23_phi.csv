Marcus  Allen,3/23/1985,"Iâ€™ve been drinking a lot more than I used to. At first it was just on weekends, but now I need a drink just to get through the day. Iâ€™ve been missing work, getting into arguments with my partner, and I know itâ€™s getting out of handâ€”but I donâ€™t know how to stop. I tried cutting back and couldnâ€™t.","Based on the clinical context, self-report, and inventory scores summary, my diagnostic impression is that you may be suffering from alcohol use disorder (AUD). The self-report of increased drinking and negative consequences suggests excessive alcohol consumption. Although there are no specific inventory scores for AUD in this case, a score greater than or equal to 14 on the PHQ-4 is considered indicative of depression, which often co-occurs with AUD. It's important to note that only a trained clinician can make an accurate diagnosis based on these factors alone."
