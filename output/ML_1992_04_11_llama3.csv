Maya  Lopez,4/11/1992,"Iâ€™ve been hearing voices that no one else hears. Sometimes they whisper, sometimes they yell at me. Iâ€™ve seen people watching me who disappear when I turn around. I feel like my thoughts arenâ€™t mine, or that someoneâ€™s putting ideas in my head. Itâ€™s terrifying, and I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s real anymore.","Based on the clinical context, patient's self-report, and inventory scores, I formulate a diagnostic impression as follows:

This individual presents with symptoms consistent with a psychotic disorder, characterized by experiences of auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and disturbances in thought processes. The reported feelings of loss of control over one's thoughts and perceptions suggest a sense of disconnection from reality, which may be indicative of a more severe mental health condition. A comprehensive evaluation is warranted to determine the nature and severity of this individual's symptoms."
