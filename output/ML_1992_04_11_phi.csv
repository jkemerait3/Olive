Maya Lopez,4/11/1992,"I’ve been hearing voices that no one else hears. Sometimes they whisper, sometimes they yell at me. I’ve seen people watching me who disappear when I turn around. I feel like my thoughts aren’t mine, or that someone’s putting ideas in my head. It’s terrifying, and I don’t know what’s real anymore.","Based on the clinical context provided by the patient, it appears that they may be experiencing symptoms of psychosis. The self-report suggests that they are hearing voices and feeling like their thoughts aren't their own. However, without any other information or assessments, such as the PCL-5 score or any other diagnostic tools, it is not possible to provide a more accurate diagnosis. It is recommended that further assessment and evaluation be conducted by a qualified clinician in order to make an appropriate diagnosis."
