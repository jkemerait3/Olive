Maya Mitchell,05/17/1994,"Lately, I’ve just been feeling really down. I’m tired all the time, even after sleeping for hours. I’ve lost interest in the things I used to enjoy like painting or going out with friends. I find myself crying randomly and I just feel hopeless. It's been like this for weeks and I’m starting to wonder if there’s something seriously wrong with me.","Based on the patient's self-report and inventory scores summary, it appears that they are experiencing symptoms of depression. The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) score of 12 suggests a possible diagnosis of major depressive disorder. While the GAD-7 score of 0 indicates no significant anxiety symptoms, and SPIN score of 0 also indicates no significant psychotic features. However, further evaluation from a clinician is recommended to confirm this preliminary impression."
