I feel like my thoughts aren’t mine, or that someone’s putting ideas in my head. It’s terrifying, and I don’t know what’s real anymore.""","Based on the clinical context, self-report, and inventory scores provided, it appears that you may be experiencing symptoms of psychosis. The absence of any other clinical conditions suggests a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, but further assessment and consultation with a clinician is recommended to confirm this."
