PTSD is a mental health condition that involves reexperiencing traumatic events through intrusive memories or nightmares, avoiding reminders of the event, and hyperarousal symptoms such as increased heart rate, nervousness, or difficulty sleeping and eating. Acute grief is a normal response to losing a loved one in an unexpected and violent manner, but it can become problematic if it interferes with daily functioning, causes distress, or persists for more than six months. The patient's scores on the PHQ-4 questionnaire indicate that he/she meets the criteria for PTSD, as indicated by having five of the nine possible symptoms. Therefore, the next steps for a human provider would be to conduct a comprehensive psychiatric assessment, rule out any other medical conditions or substances that could mimic or worsen the symptoms, and provide appropriate treatment options such as psychotherapy or medication."
