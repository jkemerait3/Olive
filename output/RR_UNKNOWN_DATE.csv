Depression is a common mental disorder that can cause persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest, and lack of motivation. The patient may also experience insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts. The next steps for a human provider are to conduct a thorough clinical evaluation, rule out any medical causes, and prescribe appropriate treatment options such as medication, psychotherapy, or lifestyle changes."
