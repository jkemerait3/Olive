Sarah Mitchell,05/17/1994,"Lately, I’ve just been feeling really down. I’m tired all the time, even after sleeping for hours. I’ve lost interest in the things I used to enjoy like painting or going out with friends. I find myself crying randomly and I just feel hopeless. It's been like this for weeks and I’m starting to wonder if there’s something seriously wrong with me.","Based on the information provided, it appears that you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. The presence of fatigue, lack of interest in activities, and feelings of hopelessness are consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymia. It is recommended to speak to a mental health professional for further evaluation and treatment options."
