Sarah  Mitchell,5/17/1994,"Lately, Iâ€™ve just been feeling really down. Iâ€™m tired all the time, even after sleeping for hours. Iâ€™ve lost interest in the things I used to enjoy like painting or going out with friends. I find myself crying randomly and I just feel hopeless. It's been like this for weeks and Iâ€™m starting to wonder if thereâ€™s something seriously wrong with me.","Based on the clinical context, self-report, and inventory scores, my diagnostic impression is that this patient is likely experiencing a significant depressive episode, characterized by symptoms of fatigue, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and dysphoria. The high score on the BDI-II suggests a substantial impact on daily functioning, with decreased interest in activities and persistent sadness."
