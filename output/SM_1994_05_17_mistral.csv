Sarah Mitchell,5/17/1994,"Lately, Iâ€™ve just been feeling really down. Iâ€™m tired all the time, even after sleeping for hours. Iâ€™ve lost interest in the things I used to enjoy like painting or going out with friends. I find myself crying randomly and I just feel hopeless.

The PHQ-4 score suggests significant levels of both anxiety and depression, while the PHQ-9 and BDI-II scores point towards depressed mood, anhedonia (loss of pleasure), fatigue, insomnia, feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal ideation. It's crucial to have a thorough clinical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan."
