Sarah  Mitchell,5/17/1994,"Lately, I’ve just been feeling really down. I’m tired all the time, even after sleeping for hours. I’ve lost interest in the things I used to enjoy like painting or going out with friends. I find myself crying randomly and I just feel hopeless. It's been like this for weeks and I’m starting to wonder if there’s something seriously wrong with me.","Based on your clinical context, self-report, and the inventory scores, it appears that you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Your PHQ-4 score is above the cutoff for mild to moderate depression, which indicates a need for further evaluation by a mental health professional. Additionally, although your GAD-7 score is low, indicating minimal anxiety, your elevated PHQ-9 score suggests a higher level of depressive symptomatology. I would recommend reaching out to your healthcare provider or seeking help from a mental health clinician to discuss your symptoms and develop a treatment plan."
