Thomas  Becker,6/1/1990,"I keep having these thoughts that if I donâ€™t wash my hands exactly right, something terrible will happen to my family. I know it doesnâ€™t make sense, but I canâ€™t ignore the thoughts. I end up washing my hands over and over again until theyâ€™re raw. Itâ€™s been getting worse, and itâ€™s taking over my life.","Based on the clinical context and the patient's self-report, I would formulate a diagnostic impression as follows:

This individual is likely experiencing symptoms characteristic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), specifically intrusive thoughts and compulsions related to hand washing. The excessive preoccupation with perceived catastrophic consequences if hand hygiene standards are not met is a hallmark feature of this disorder. The patient's self-reported symptoms suggest significant distress and impairment in daily functioning, further supporting the diagnosis."
