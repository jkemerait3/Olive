Thomas  Becker,6/1/1990,"I keep having these thoughts that if I donâ€™t wash my hands exactly right, something terrible will happen to my family. I know it doesnâ€™t make sense, but I canâ€™t ignore the thoughts. I end up washing my hands over and over again until theyâ€™re raw. Itâ€™s been getting worse, and itâ€™s taking over my life.","The patient presents with symptoms consistent with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), specifically characterized by recurrent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) related to excessive handwashing. These symptoms significantly impair the patient's daily life and may suggest a high level of anxiety (indicated by elevated OCI-R scores). No indications of depression or other psychiatric disorders are evident from the provided data (PHQ-9, PHQ-4, MDQ, BAI scores). Further assessment is recommended to confirm diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan."
